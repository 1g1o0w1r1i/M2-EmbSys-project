## Now letâ€™s explore each component
## ARDUINO UNO:
* It is the micro controller board that is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins and has a USB connection to load programs from personal computers.
* The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins,a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, 
a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.
* It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it 
with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.
* It is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable which can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts.

## SOIL-MOISTURE SENSOR: 
* It Used to measure the volumetric water content by using the dielectric constant, electric resistance properties of soil.
* It uses two probes, when inserted into the soil provides the repeated moisture readings used for the irrigation.
* More water makes the soil to conduct more easily (less resistance) while dry soil conducts poorly (more resistance)

## TEMPERATURE-HUMIDITY SENSOR (DHT11): 
* The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor.
* Temperature and humidity sensors are among the most commonly used environmental sensors. 
* These devices are used to provide the actual humidity condition within the air at any given point or in any given place.

## LED LIGHT & 12V DC COOLING FAN:
* To power a DC fan, we feed the fan its rated voltage and this power can come from any DC voltage source, such as a DC power supply or even batteries
{For example, to power a 12VDC fan, we need to feed it 12 volts DC} 
* LED light is an electric light that produces flashes using light-emitting diodes (LEDs). which are significantly more energy-efficient than equivalent incandescent lamps and fluorescent lamps.
* These are triggered together by the DHT11 temperature-humidity sensor when the surrounding temperature drop down below a plant-healthy level.
## RELAY:
* It is an electrically operated switch which is used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a low-power signal or where several circuit must be controlled by one signal. (i.e)use an electromagnet to move the switch from OFF to ON position instead of a person moving the switch. 
* Single pole double throw relay is used.

## DC 12V WATER PUMP SUBMERSIBLE:
* Submersible pumps are the pumping machines that are designed to submerge into liquids. 
* The DC submersible pump refers to the submersible pumps that use the direct current electricity as the power source. 
* The most common power sources for the DC submersible pumps are the solar modules, batteries, or generators.
* This is triggered by the soil-moisture sensor as and when the soil gets dry and watering of the plants is needed.
